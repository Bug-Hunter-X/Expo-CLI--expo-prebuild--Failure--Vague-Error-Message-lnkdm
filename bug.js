While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command. The error message was vague, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without any specific details about the cause.  My project was relatively simple, using only standard Expo modules and no custom native modules. I had already ensured that all dependencies were installed correctly and that my project setup was according to Expo documentation.
