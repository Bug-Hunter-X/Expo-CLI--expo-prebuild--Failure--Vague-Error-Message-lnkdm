The vague error message from `expo prebuild` often points to underlying issues that aren't directly reported. In this case, the solution involved several steps:

1. **Cleaning the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`). Then, reinstall dependencies using `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
2. **Clearing the cache:** Expo maintains a cache. Clearing this cache can resolve problems. You can try deleting the Expo cache directory (location varies by OS, consult Expo documentation). 
3. **Checking for conflicting dependencies:** Examine your `package.json` for any dependencies that might be incompatible or have conflicting versions. Resolving version conflicts through updates or downgrades might help.
4. **Restarting the system:** A simple system restart often clears transient issues that might interfere with the build process.

If none of these steps work, provide more details about your project setup, dependencies, and the complete error message (if available) for more focused assistance.
